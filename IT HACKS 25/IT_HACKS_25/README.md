# IT HACKS 25 - Poultry Performance Tracker (Starter Repo)

This repository contains a starter scaffold for a responsive web dashboard (Next.js + Tailwind) and a FastAPI backend.
It includes Dockerfiles and a docker-compose setup for local testing.
The backend includes example CSV analysis logic using pandas and scikit-learn and a synthetic sample CSV to test uploads.

## Quick start (local)
Requirements: Docker & Docker Compose, or Node & Python installed locally.

### Using Docker Compose (recommended)
```bash
# from repository root
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:8000
```

### Running services manually (without Docker)
#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Whatâ€™s included
- `frontend/` Next.js + Tailwind starter with basic pages: Dashboard, Upload
- `backend/` FastAPI app with CSV upload endpoint, analytics endpoint, and a simple ML pipeline example
- `sample_data/` example CSV and a small synthetic data generator script
- `docker-compose.yml` to run both services together

## CSV format (sample)
Header expected:
```
farm_id,room_id,date,age_days,temperature_c,humidity_pct,ammonia_ppm,feed_consumed_kg,feed_type,vitamins,disinfectant_used,mortality_count,egg_count,avg_weight_kg,bird_count
```

Please open the repo in VS Code and start the services. Good luck with IT HACKS 25!
